abstract = {Computational kinematic analysis of mechanisms is a promising tool for the development of new classes of manipulators. In this paper, the authors present a velocity equation to be compiled by general-purpose software and applicable to any mechanism topology. First, the approach to model the mechanism is introduced. The method uses a set of kinematic restrictions applied to characteristic points of the mechanism. The resultant velocity equation is not an input–output equation, but a comprehensive one. In addition, the Jacobian characterizing the equation is dimensionless hence extremely useful for singularity and performance indicators. The motion space of the manipulator is obtained from the velocity equation. Angular velocities are compiled out of three non-collinear point velocities. The procedure is applied to a 3-DoF parallel manipulator to illustrate.},

We emphasize on the limits of this criterion by applying it to three parallel robots and ascertaining that the results are erroneous. In fact, this criterion does not fit for many classical mechanisms or modern parallel robots. We explain why this criterion does not work for certain mechanisms and we accurately limit its applicability. We found our proof on the theory of linear transformations. As far as we are aware this paper presents for the first time an accurate applicability limitation of this well known criterion with huge and long-time utilisation in analysis and synthesis of mechanisms.},

This paper gives a simple method to calculate the mobility of all kinds of parallel mechanisms only with Jacobian matrixes. It can analyze composition of degrees-of-freedom and output speeds of moving platform in passing. Furthermore, this method can be used to determine the existence of inactive joints and equivalent serial chain of complicated parallel chain.},
