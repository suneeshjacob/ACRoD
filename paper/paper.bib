Res., 27(8), pp. 967–983), the dynamic properties of rigid-link parallel manipulators, in the presence of type 2 singularities, have been studied. It was shown that any parallel manipulator can pass through the singular positions without perturbation of motion if the wrench applied on the end-effector by the legs and external efforts of the manipulator are orthogonal to the twist along the direction of the uncontrollable motion. This condition was obtained using the symbolic approach based on the inverse dynamics and the study of the Lagrangian of a general rigid-link parallel manipulator. It was validated by experimental tests carried out on the prototype of a four-degrees-of-freedom parallel manipulator. However, it is known that the flexibility of the mechanism may not always be neglected. Indeed, joint flexibility is the main source contributing to the overall manipulator flexibility and it leads to the trajectory distortion. Therefore, in this paper, the condition for passing through a type 2 singularity of parallel manipulators with flexible joints is studied. The suggested technique is illustrated by the example of a 5R parallel manipulator with flexible joints. It is shown that passing through singularity is possible if the 12th-order polynomial trajectory planning is applied. The obtained results are validated by the numerical simulations carried out using the ADAMS software.}",

abstract = {Three-degree-of-freedom planar parallel robots are increasingly being used in applications where precision is of the utmost importance. Clearly, methods for evaluating the accuracy of these robots are therefore needed. The accuracy of well designed, manufactured, and calibrated parallel robots depends mostly on the input errors (sensor and control errors). Dexterity and other similar performance indices have often been used to evaluate indirectly the influence of input errors. However, industry needs a precise knowledge of the maximum orientation and position output errors at a given nominal configuration. An interval analysis method that can be adapted for this purpose has been proposed in the literature, but gives no kinematic insight into the problem of optimal design. In this paper, a simpler method is proposed based on a detailed error analysis of 3-DOF planar parallel robots that brings valuable understanding of the problem of error amplification.}

Among all the proposed solutions to that, crossing Type 2 singularities using dedicated trajectory generation and multi-model controller has a great potential. Yet, this approach is not sufficient for the robot to operate autonomously, as assembly mode detection during the motion currently requires additional redundant information. To tackle this problem, we propose an algorithm based on Interval Analysis (IA) that is able to track the end-effector of the robot even under assembly mode change. IA-based solvers for the forward kinematic problem of parallel robots are well known, but they cannot be used under assembly mode change. Compared to those classical approaches, the major modification introduced is the tracking of end-effector velocity in addition to its pose. Using this new information of velocity, the algorithm is capable to monitor the assembly mode change of the robot happening when the singularities are crossed. The behavior and the reliability of this algorithm are analyzed experimentally on a five-bar planar parallel mechanism.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989720},  ISSN={},  month={May},}

Nevertheless, this assumption cannot be verified in reality due to modelling errors which largely impact the control law used to follow the desired trajectory. Therefore, if the optimal trajectory is not perfectly tracked, the dynamic model can degenerate near the Type 2 singularities and the robot might stay blocked. In order to solve that problem, this paper proposes a multimodel approach that allows parallel robots to cross the Type 2 singularities without any torque discontinuity. The main idea is to shift near singularities from the full robot dynamic model to another simplified one that can never degenerate.

abstract = {This paper presents an analytical approach for the dimensional synthesis of the 3-DOF Delta parallel robot for a prescribed workspace. The dimensional synthesis of parallel robots is a challenging problem for which obtaining an analytical solution is a cumbersome task and no appropriate analytical closed-form solution has been developed for the DPR so far. First, the workspace is analytically calculated based on inverse kinematic and it showed that the workspace of DPR comes from some geometric conditions. Afterward, the largest possible box which can be inserted in the workspace is obtained. Optimal analytical dimensional design for a prescribed workspace is calculated by considering three types of construction constraints. Optimization objectives based on subjective and the smallest robot criterion have been defined which is optimized by resorting to the so-called Lagrange multiplier method. The results revealed that in the best case of the existing industrial robots, workspace expression is only close to %87.29 of the optimal workspace of this paper and in optimal design it could have up to %51.70 smaller robot with the same given workspace.}

The emphasis is placed on obtaining the maximum volume ellipsoid or sphere in the singularity-free subregions, while taking into account the actuator strokes. The proposed algorithms are based on the convex optimization and have several advantages over the existing methods such as Lagrange multipliers approach, which makes it appropriate for other applicable optimization problems. For determining the maximal singularity-free zones, in order to find the maximum volume ellipsoid, a judicious iterative procedure, referred to as Improved Lower Bound Semidefinite Programming, is proposed. Additionally, different reformulations of the problem are proposed in order to solve other interesting problems in the robotics community such as obtaining the maximum volume sphere. Furthermore, an approach based on the sum of squares method is proposed to solve this problem for a general Gough–Stewart platform with any arbitrary geometric parameter which is conducive to a polynomial optimization problem. The computational time for the proposed algorithms are considerably low compared to other methods proposed in the literature for obtaining the singularity-free workspace which opens an avenue to use them as systematic algorithms for on-line purposes.}

Through the use of planar quaternions, it is shown that for the case of a planar 2R arm, the problem of rational motion synthesis can be reduced to that of circular interpolations in two separate planes and that for the case of a planar 3R arm, the problem can be reduced to a combination of circular interpolation in one plane and a constrained spline interpolation in a circular ring on another plane. Due to the limitation of circular interpolation, only C1 continuous rational motions are generated that satisfy the kinematic constraints exactly. For applications that require C2 continuous motions, this paper presents a method for generating C2 continuous motions that approximate the kinematic constraints for planar 2R and 3R robot arms.}",

Unfortunately, the problems are not restricted to just these particular areas in robotics but are connected with misleading definitions of the metric properties of the six- dimensional wrench and twist vector spaces used in robotics. The current definitions lead to inconsistent results (i.e., results that are not invariant with respect to changes in the reference frame andlor changes in the dimensional units used to express the problem. As a matter of fact, given a linear systemu = Ax,where the matrix A may be singular, the Moore-Penrose theory of generalized inverses may be properly and directly applied only when the vector space U of vectoruand the vector space X of vector xare inner product spaces. Arbitrary assignment of Euclidean inner products to the space U and X when the vectorsu andxhave elements with different physical units can lead to inconsistent and noninvariant results. In this article the problem of inconsistent, noninvariant solutionsXs tou = Axin robotics is briefly reviewed and a general theory for com puting consistent, gauge-invariant solutions to nonhomogeneous systems of the formu = Axis developed. In addition, the dual relationship between rigid-body kinematics and statics is de fined formally as a particular, linear algebraic system whose solution system is also a dual system. Examples illustrate the theory. }

abstract = {The condition number of the Jacobian matrix has been commonly used in determining the dexterous regions of a manipulator workspace. This has been successful when applied to manipulators having either solely spherical or solely Cartesian degrees of freedom. However, for manipulators having a mix of both rotational and translational degrees of freedom, i.e., complex degree of freedom manipulators, the condition number of the Jacobian matrix may not be used due to dimensional inconsistencies with its elements. This paper furthers earlier work introduced in obtaining a Jacobian matrix which may be used to determine the dexterity of parallel mechanisms regardless of the number and type of degrees of freedom of the mechanism. The result of the method introduced in this paper is a dimensionally homogeneous Jacobian matrix mapping m actuator velocities to n independent end effector velocities. In the typical case where m=n, the Jacobian matrix is also square. As opposed to earlier works, the singular values of the Jacobian matrix obtained here have an evident physical significance. Furthermore, the ratio of the maximum and minimum singular values, i.e., the condition number may be used to measure the dexterity of the manipulator at a given pose. To illustrate the concepts introduced in this paper, the 3-PRS manipulator is analyzed.}

Utilizing the concept of the reciprocal Jacobian, the forward statics relation for each of the serial kinematic chains of a parallel manipulator can be first obtained and then used to derive both the forward statics and the inverse velocity relations of the manipulator. The screw based Jacobian of a parallel manipulator can be formulated from the inverse velocity relation in such a way that it consists of the reciprocal Jacobians of the serial kinematic chains. Since any reciprocal Jacobian is unique to the corresponding serial chain, the suggested form of the screw based Jacobian is also determined uniquely to the lower mobility parallel manipulator. Two examples are given to illustrate the proposed method, one for the 3DOF parallel manipulator with three identical prismatic-revolute-spherical joints-serial chains and the other for the 4DOF parallel manipulator with nonidentical serial chains (two spherical-prismatic-spherical- and one revolute-revolute-prismatic-revolute joints-serial chains).}",

Given the definitions of twist/wrench spaces and their subspaces of the end-effector, the underlying relationships amongst these subspaces are identified using the virtual work principle. Using the orthogonal and dual properties of these subspaces and variational representations to account for the permitted and restricted instantaneous motions of the end-effector, a rigorous general and systematic procedure for the formulation of a generalized Jacobian is proposed. The merit of the generalized Jacobian is that it allows the first order kinematic and static modeling (velocity, accuracy, force and stiffness) to be integrated into a unified mathematical framework, so standardizing the modeling procedure and improving the efficiency of design and analysis. The generalized Jacobians for the three well-known parallel manipulators are derived as examples to illustrate the generality and effectiveness of this approach.}

abstract = {Parallel manipulators with two end-effectors (PM2Es) enable the design of gripping robots with high dynamic performance. The gripping action is enabled by internal, relative degrees of freedom (DoFs) between the two end-effectors. Many standard methods for the analysis and control of parallel manipulators rely on a Jacobian, where a complete Jacobian analysis includes constraint relations. These constraint relations have not been consistently included in previous analyses of PM2Es, while they are specifically relevant for PM2Es because constraints play an important role in the static force analysis of a PM2E. This is because wrenches applied by the actuators can be transferred to the end-effectors through internal constraints, an effect which is not captured by kinematic relations alone. This paper presents a systematic approach to perform the Jacobian analysis of PM2Es, which is based on screw theory, and that takes all constraint relations into account. The approach is applied to a PM2E with three legs and one internal closed-loop chain. An example mechanism was built to experimentally validate the resulting Jacobian analysis using a static force analysis.}

    abstract = { Singularity prediction of Jacobian is inherently related to the design of any manipulator. Optimization of Jacobian is known to improve the joint rates and joint torques for the same set of end-effector twists and wrenches. Any mathematical entity which is an estimator of Jacobian can be used as a manifestation of the stated two schemes. It is required that online computation of Jacobian be implemented so that singular poses can be avoided and performance is maximized. We present an algorithm that relates to the determinant of the Jacobian for robotic manipulators. The algorithm developed is quicker to compute, and a strategy is developed to synthesize the local estimator contour. The contours change dynamically, henceforth optimal motor torques (in case of presence of interaction fields or system requiring force control) and optimal joint rates can be defined, depending on the control algorithm. The algorithm developed is independent of the structure of the matrix and is generalized to any six DoF manipulator structure used. }

The effect of linear combinations on the repelling screw system is revealed, and further used to determine the constraint wrenches/twists of a parallel manipulator and its limbs. By means of utilising repelling screws, the dualities in parallel and serial mechanisms are revisited and extended. Furthermore, a simple and unified method for the identification of unknown twists and wrenches is proposed, based upon which an intuitive and systematic approach for the formulation of generalized Jacobian matrices for nonredundant parallel manipulators is derived. The generalized multilevel hierarchical Jacobian contains complete constraint, singularity, kinematics, and statics information at both limb and platform levels.
