# Automatic Computation for Robot Design (ACRoD) 

## Description (For `next_version` branch)

This branch is planned for publishing Python scripts to automatically formulate Jacobian for multiple end-effector points, thereby removing the limitation of "single end-effector point" of ACRoD. After gathering successful scripts, this branch is planned to be merged with the main branch.
