# ACRoD
Automatic Computation for Robot Design

This repository is dedicated to develop functions for automatic computations for designing robotic manipulators.

Currently available functions:

- Jacobian formulation for spatial manipulators around a given end-effector point.
- Jacobian formulation for parallel manipulators around a given end-effector point.
