# Automatic Computation for Robot Design (ACRoD) [![status](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/2c8c94adbd8240eadaa4f77c2057b14c/status.svg)](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/2c8c94adbd8240eadaa4f77c2057b14c)

## Description (For `next_version` branch)

This branch is planned for publishing Python scripts to automatically formulate Jacobian for multiple end-effector points, thereby removing the limitation of "single end-effector point" of ACRoD. After gathering successful scripts, this branch is planned to be merged with the main branch.
